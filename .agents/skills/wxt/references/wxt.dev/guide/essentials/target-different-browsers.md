# Targeting Different Browsers [​](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/target-different-browsers.html#targeting-different-browsers)

When building an extension with WXT, you can create multiple builds of your extension targeting different browsers and manifest versions.

## Target a Browser [​](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/target-different-browsers.html#target-a-browser)

Use the `-b` CLI flag to create a separate build of your extension for a specific browser. By default, `chrome` is targeted.

sh

```
wxt            # same as: wxt -b chrome
wxt -b firefox
wxt -b custom
```

During development, if you target Firefox, Firefox will open. All other strings open Chrome by default. To customize which browsers open, see [Set Browser Binaries](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/browser-startup.html#set-browser-binaries).

Additionally, WXT defines several constants you can use at runtime to detect which browser is in use:

ts

```
if (import.meta.env.BROWSER === 'firefox') {
  console.log('Do something only in Firefox builds');
}
if (import.meta.env.FIREFOX) {
  // Shorthand, equivalent to the if-statement above
}
```

Read about [Built-in Environment Variables](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/environment-variables.html#built-in-environment-variables) for more details.

## Target a Manifest Version [​](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/target-different-browsers.html#target-a-manifest-version)

To target specific manifest versions, use the `--mv2` or `--mv3` CLI flags.

Default Manifest Version

By default, WXT will target MV2 for Safari and Firefox and MV3 for all other browsers.

Similar to the browser, you can get the target manifest version at runtime using the [built-in environment variable](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/environment-variables.html#built-in-environment-variables):

ts

```
if (import.meta.env.MANIFEST_VERSION === 2) {
  console.log('Do something only in MV2 builds');
}
```

## Filtering Entrypoints [​](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/target-different-browsers.html#filtering-entrypoints)

Every entrypoint can be included or excluded when targeting specific browsers via the `include` and `exclude` options.

Here are some examples:

* Content script only built when targeting `firefox`:

  ts

  ```
  export default defineContentScript({
    include: ['firefox'],

    main(ctx) {
      // ...
    },
  });
  ```
* HTML file only built for all targets other than `chrome`:

  html

  ```
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
      <meta name="manifest.exclude" content="['chrome', ...]" />
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- ... -->
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

Alternatively, you can use the [`filterEntrypoints` config](https://wxt.dev/api/reference/wxt/interfaces/inlineconfig.html#filterentrypoints) to list all the entrypoints you want to build.
